# Zert

Conversational AI Sandbox with ChatGPT

### Introduction

Generative Pre-trained Transformer, is an AI language model developed by OpenAI. It utilizes transformer architecture, which has been successful in natural language processing tasks. The "pre-trained" aspect means that the model is trained on a large and diverse dataset before being fine-tuned for specific tasks. During pre-training, the model learns to predict the next word in a sentence based on context from preceding words, enabling it to understand language structure and semantics. The "generative" aspect enables the model to produce coherent and relevant text when given a prompt, allowing it to perform tasks such as translation, text completion, summarization,and question-answering.
