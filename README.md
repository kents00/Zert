# Zert

Conversational AI Sandbox with ChatGPT

### Introduction

Generative Pre-trained Transformer, is an AI language model developed by OpenAI. It utilizes transformer architecture, which has been successful in natural language processing tasks. The "pre-trained" aspect means that the model is trained on a large and diverse dataset before being fine-tuned for specific tasks. During pre-training, the model learns to predict the next word in a sentence based on context from preceding words, enabling it to understand language structure and semantics. The "generative" aspect enables the model to produce coherent and relevant text when given a prompt, allowing it to perform tasks such as translation, text completion, summarization,and question-answering.

### Installation

To install zert and it locally paste this into your terminal:

```bash
// installing requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

//run into your local machine
flask --app app run
```

If you encounter issues installing this in your terminal, it may be because pip is not installed. You can visit the following websites for installation guidance on [Windows](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-pip-windows) and [WSL](https://monovm.com/blog/how-to-install-pip-on-windows-linux/)

You can also specify the environment variables in your Flask app by modifying the .flaskenv. It is important to create a .env file for your OpenAI secret key; you can find it [here](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-api-key)

```bash
// .flaskenv
FLASK_ENV = development
FLASK_APP = app.py
FLASK_DEBUG = True

// .env (create newfile)
OPENAI_API_KEY = your secret key here
```
